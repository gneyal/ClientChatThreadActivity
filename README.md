ClientChatThreadActivity
========================

A socket based chat client - for learning purposes only.

This should operate with ForwardServer - another repository you can find under my account.

1. Configure ForwardServer to listen on two available ports (port "a" and port "b") on you machine.
2. Run two emulators.
3. Run emulator A with ClientChatThreadActivity::PORT = a
4. Run emulator B with ClientChatThreadActivity::PORT = b
5. You can now talk to each other!
